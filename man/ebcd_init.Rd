\title{Initialize ebcd object}
\usage{
ebcd_init(X = NULL, S = NULL, C = NULL, N = NULL, tol = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{N-by-P data matrix with N observations and P variables}

\item{S}{P-by-P covariance/Gram matrix \eqn{=X'X/N}}

\item{C}{P-by-P compact target matrix such that \eqn{C'C=X'X}}

\item{N}{number of observations}

\item{tol}{tolerance}
}
\value{
An initialized ebcd object
}
\description{
Initialize an ebcd object with no factors, taking as an input one of
data matrix \eqn{X}, covariance matrix \eqn{S}, or compact target matrix \eqn{C}.
The algorithm runs on either \eqn{X} or \eqn{C}, which is internally saved as \eqn{A}.
